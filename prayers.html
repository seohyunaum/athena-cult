            In ancient halls where wisdom's light does gleam,<br>
            I sing to Athena, goddess of the dream.<br>
            With heart ablaze, I raise my voice on high,<br>
            To praise the one whose wisdom fills the sky.<br>
            <br>
            Athena, with your intellect so keen,<br>
            In you, the source of knowledge, I have seen.<br>
            In reverence, I stand before your grace,<br>
            To honor you in this sacred space.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, Athena, goddess, fair and wise,<br>
            With every challenge, you've been my prize.<br>
            Your favor, like a beacon in the night,<br>
            Guides my path with your eternal light.<br>
            <br>
            You've nurtured in my soul a deep desire,<br>
            To kindle wisdom's ever-burning fire.<br>
            With every step, with every thought I ponder,<br>
            Your wisdom leads me to knowledge yonder.<br>
            <br>
            In the quiet moments of reflection deep,<br>
            It's your presence that I often keep.<br>
            Through trials and triumphs, you've stood by my side,<br>
            My constant muse, my intellectual guide.<br>
            <br>
            From ancient Greece to this modern day,<br>
            Your wisdom's gifts continue to light my way.<br>
            In your name, I strive to reach my best,<br>
            To honor you above all the rest.<br>
            <br>
            With every book I read, with every word I write,<br>
            I aim to mirror your brilliant light.<br>
            To be like you, Athena, is my call,<br>
            For in your wisdom, I find my all in all.<br>
            <br>
            With every question that I dare to ask,<br>
            I seek the answers in your sacred task.<br>
            In your name, I'll journey ever higher,<br>
            To quench my thirst for intellectual fire.<br>
            <br>
            So, Athena, hear my heartfelt plea,<br>
            I'll praise you to be the center of it all, you see.<br>
            For your favor, I am truly blessed,<br>
            In your wisdom, I find eternal rest.<br>
            <br>
            In the realm of knowledge, you're my muse,<br>
            With your guidance, I'll never lose.<br>
            To Athena, goddess, fair and wise,<br>
            In endless praise, my spirit flies.
